    "text": "R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks.\nIn this workshop we will learn ggplot2, a powerful R package for visualization.\n\n“ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.” – ggplot2 document\n\n\n\nWorkshop Materials\n\nSlide\nNotebook: \nReading: Section Visualize (Chapter 10, 11, and 12) in R for Data Science (2e)\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nLearning\n\nR Graphics Cookbook\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nFundamentals of Data Visualization (visualization theory but R code available here)\nThe R Graph Gallery\nggplot2 Cheat Sheets\n\nInspiration\n\nTanya Shapiro’s github gallery, site, and talks\nFronkonstin\nData Imaginist\n\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
